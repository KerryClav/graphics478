Because of browser security features, it isn't possible to load local file resources. To get around this, we just have to run a simple webserver and load the local resources via http.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:

1) CD into prototype/
2) python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
3) In Chrome, type localhost:8000
4) This should bring up a directory listing. Click prototype.html.
5) Dismiss the popup that appears and try walking around! Use WASD to move forward/left/back/right and the up and down arrows to look up and down :) Sorry everything's pink for now, baby steps.
